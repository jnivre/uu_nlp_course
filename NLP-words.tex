\section{Introduction}
\indent This assignment involves material from lectures 1 to 4. You should have
watched the relevant videos, read the relevant chapters in the textbook and
made a serious attempt at completing the relevant labs before you attempt this
assignment.
If you feel you have done that and still find the instructions unclear, you are
welcome to email the course teachers and/or go to office hours to ask for
help.
The assignment is split into 2 sections, one about tokenization, one about
language modelling and probability and statistics. Each section is worth 10
points. We expect between half a page and a page for each section. Please do
not submit more than 4 pages overall. 
You answers for each section should be self-contained.
\section{Tokenization}
In the videos and the book chapters, you learned about regular expressions (if
you did not already know all about them before that ;)). In the labs, you got
to play with regular expressions in the context of tokenization.
You started with a very simple tokenizer and gradually refined it by looking at
the errors it was making. 
If you have not done so already, try to improve it so that it reaches at least
95\% precision and recall.  
Describe your approach to improving it. You may illustrate the problems you
dealt with by adding snippets of code.

\todo{Add info on how they will receive the new test set}
You will receive a new test set {\tt dev2-raw.txt} to run your tokenizer on.  
Write down for yourself your expectation of how good you think your tokenizer
is going to be before running it.  
Compare the output of your system against {\tt dev2-gold-sent.txt} and discuss
the result. Are there still cases of under/oversplitting? If so, can you
identify the reason? Can you identify difficult challenges?

\section{Language Modelling}
\indent In Lab 3, you learned about how to use MLE for language modelling.
Hopefully, in the lab, you saw its limitations. 
In Lab 4, you experimented with smoothing methods.\\
\indent Define MLE and discuss its limitations. Explain the principles behind
smoothing and how they help circumvent the limitations of MLE. Illustrate this
with examples. (You may take them from the Sherlock Holmes text but use
different examples than those we asked you to look at in the labs.)\\
\indent Describe and compare different smoothing methods.  Illustrate your
answer with results from experiments you made in the lab. You may use the table
you produced during the lab.

\section{Grading Criteria}
\begin{titlemize}{Basic Criteria}
    \item The problem is clearly stated and the student demonstrates an
        understanding of the problem.
    \item The answer is coherent
    \item The quality of the answer is in understandable English
\end{titlemize}
\begin{titlemize}{Additional Criteria}
    \item The problem is well illustrated
    \item Solutions to the problem are described
    \item The student demonstrates extensive knowledge of the textbook chapter
\end{titlemize}

\begin{titlemize}{Points}
    \item 1-4: poor on each of the basic criteria
    \item 5-6: fair on each of the basic criteria
    \item 7: at least fair on each of the basic criteria and fair on some of
        the additional criteria
    \item 8: at least good on each of the basic criteria and at least fair on
        each of the additional criteria
    \item 9: at least good on each of the basic criteria and at least fair and
        most times good or excellent on each of tem the additional criteria
    \item 10: good or excellent on each of the basic and additional criteria.
\end{titlemize}

\section{Submit the assignment}
Submit your assignment as a pdf file on \textit{studentportalen} before Monday
20th November 20:00.
To pass the assignment, you must have answered both questions, reached at least
5 points in each question and at least 12 overall.
To get VG, you should obtain at least 8 in each question and at least 18 points
overall.
