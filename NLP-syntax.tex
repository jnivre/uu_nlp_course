\section{Introduction}
\noindent This assignment involves material from classes 8, 9 and
10. You should have watched the relevant videos, read the relevant
chapters in the textbook and made a serious attempt at completing the
relevant labs before you attempt this assignment. If you feel you have
done that and still find the instructions unclear, you are welcome to
email the course teachers and/or go to office hours to ask for help.
We indicate after each subtask how much we expect you to write. 
Please do not submit more than 4 pages overall.  All answers 
should be self-contained.  

\section{Assignment}
\noindent
The assignment is based on the sentences in the \textbf{en10} set, which you annotated in Lab 8, parsed in Lab 9
and wrote a grammar for in Lab 10:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item He worked for the BBC for a decade.
\item She spoke to CNN Style about the experience.
\item Global warming has caused a change in the pattern of the rainy seasons.
\item I also wonder whether the Davis Cup played a part.
\item The scheme makes money through sponsorship and advertising.
\item If a Turkish employee quits, then the Turkish work councils come.
\item A witness told police that the victim had attacked the suspect in April.
\item Mr Osborne signed up with a US speakers agency after being sacked in July.
\item The RHS collected comments sent in by schoolchildren and teachers involved in the experiment.
\item National reaction to the events in Kansas demonstrated how deeply divided the country had become.
\end{enumerate}
For this assignment, you should submit answers to the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt]
\item Discuss three cases, involving (at least) three different dependency relations, where your annotation in Lab 8 differed from that of another group or from the gold standard. 
Cite definitions or examples from the UD guidelines to support your conclusion about which annotation is correct in each case. (0.5 page) 
\item Discuss three different errors in the output of the parser trained in Lab 9 for the \textbf{en10} sentences. Refer to the UD documentation to explain why they are errors. (0.5 page)
\item The parser trained in Lab 9 uses the arc-eager transition system for dependency parsing described in K\"{u}bler et al. Write down the transition sequence used to construct the parse tree for sentence 1. List the content of the stack ($S$), buffer ($B$) and arc set ($A$) after each transition. (0.5 page)
\item List the grammar you designed in Lab 10 after verifying that it does in fact generate sentences 1--5 with reasonable analyses. Draw all the parse trees that the grammar assigns to sentence 3 and describe the derivation of each tree. (1 page) 
\item Draw the completed chart for a parse of sentence 1 using the CKY algorithm described in Jurafsky and Martin and explain in which order the cells are filled. (0.5 page)
\end{enumerate}
% FC removed the following as it has been said above.
% We expect between half a page and a page in response to each question. Please do not submit more than 5 pages overall. 
%Your answers to each question should be self-contained.

\section{Grading Criteria}
\begin{titlemize}{Basic Criteria}
